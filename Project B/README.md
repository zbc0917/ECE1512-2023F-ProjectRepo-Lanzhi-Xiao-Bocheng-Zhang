# Project B

## Supplementatary File

Here is the explanation of what is included in the Supplementary file:


    1.networks.ipynb is a Python notebook that provides six different networks, including MLP, Convent, LeNet, AlexNet, VGG11, and ResNet-18. You will use this file to learn synthetic dates on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets.

    2. mhist_dataset is a folder containing two subfolders, including the images and their annotations, for the MHIST dataset. All 3152 images are in the images.zip file. Annotations are included in annotations.csv. Note that this file includes each image file name and its corresponding majority-vote label and degree of annotator agreement expressed as the number of annotators who marked the image as SSA (e.g., 6 indicates 6/7 agreement with a ground truth of SSA, and 2 would indicate 5/7 agreement with a ground truth of HP).
    
    3.utils.ipynb is a Python notebook that provides utilities such as access to datasets, preprocessing, and data augmentation. You will use this file to learn synthetic dates on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets.

    4. Project_B_FAQs.pdf is a list of frequently asked questions that try to shed light on (almost) all of your questions and concerns that you may have during Project B.
